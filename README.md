While we were coding we ran into one main problem which was a paragraph tag messing with the navbar that I had coded in, but the overall experience was awesome. The way we split up the workload was at first really bad. We were just working on the homepage till about a month ago. After that we had finally found out everyone was good at. Marlin did most of the CSS work, Cordell did a lot of the information gathering, and I was the one who had started the use of the table tag witch in the long run we mastered how to make a simple website look nice by using the table tag in different ways.
